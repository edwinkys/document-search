This directory can be used to store static files.

All files in this directory will be included in the final build output.
This directory is useful for storing images, fonts, and other files that are
not processed by the build pipeline.

To reference any files in this directory, use the / prefix.

For consistency, we want to name the files in this directory with:
- Lowercase letters
- Separated by hyphens
- No spaces
