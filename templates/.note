This directory contains Supabase authentication email templates for DocuLens.

We use Jinja2 templating to generate the email templates. If we want to modify
the email templates, we can do so by modifying the Jinja2 templates in the
emails directory.

After modifying the Jinja2 templates, we can run the following command
to compile the email templates into HTML:

python build.py

This command will generate the HTML email templates in the build directory.
Unfortunately, since Supabase doesn't have an API to update email templates,
we have to manually copy the HTML email templates into the Supabase dashboard.
